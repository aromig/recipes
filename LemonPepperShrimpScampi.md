# Lemon Pepper Shrimp Scampi

Serves: 6

## Ingredients

* 1 cup uncooked orzo
* 1 tbsp parsley flakes
* 1/2 tsp salt, divided
* 3 tbsp butter, divided
* 1 1/2 lb peeled & deveined jumbo shrimp
* 2 tsp minced garlic
* 2 tbsp lemon juice
* 1/4 tsp ground black pepper

## Directions

1. Remove tails from shrimp if desired (I do!).
2. Cook orzo per package directions, omitting salt and fat (if it calls for it). Drain and place into a medium bowl. Stir in parsley, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1 tbsp butter. Cover and keep warm.
3. While orzo cooks, melt 1 tbsp butter in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.
4. Sprinkle shrimp with 1/4 tsp salt. Add half of the shrimp to pan and saute for 2 minutes or until almost done. Transfer shrimp to a plate, leaving _sauce_ in pan.
5. Saute remainder of shrimp as before. Transfer to plate.
6. Melt remaining 1 tbsp butter in pan and add garlic. Cook for about 30 seconds, stirring occassionally.
7. Stir in shrimp and add lemon juice and pepper. Cook for 1 minute or until shrimp are done.
8. Serve shrimp over a bed of orzo or separately if desired.
