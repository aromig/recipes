* 4 tbsp olive oil, separated

## Directions
1. Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a deep skillet over medium heat and add garlic for 1 minute.
2. Increase heat to high and add the meat and season well with salt & pepper. Cook until browned, crumbling as it cooks.

4. Simmer mixture for 15 minutes, then stir in the cooked rice and remove from heat.
5. Preheat oven to 350&deg; and grease a large casserole dish.
6. In another large deep pan, heat 2 more tbsp of olive oil over medium high heat and add the chopped cabbage.
7. Cook, stirring almost constantly, until the cabbage is half cooked. Add salt & pepper generously as it cooks, then remove from heat.
8. Spread about 1/2 the cabbage onto the bottom of the casserole dish, pressing it down a bit with the back of a spoon.
9. Spoon half of the meat mixture over the cabbage, then add the other half of the cabbage and finish with the rest of the mixture.
10. Cover tightly with alluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes.
11. Remove foil and sprinkle with cheeses. Bake uncovered for 10 minutes, until cheese has melted.
12. Set the oven to broil and heat for 1 1/2 minutes so the cheese begins to brown.
13. Remove from oven promptly and enjoy!
