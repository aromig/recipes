### Yield: 4.5 cups

For crumb coating & frosting a double-layer 8 or 9 inch cake, a single layer 12x18 half sheet cake, or about 24 cupcakes.

- 1&frac12; cups unsalted butter (3 sticks), softened but not melting
- 5-6 cups powdered sugar, sifted
- 2-3 tbsp heavy whipping cream
- 2 tsp clear vanilla extract
- pinch of salt
- (optional) 1 cup cocoa powder for a chocolate frosting

## Directions

1. Cut butter into 1 inch pieces.
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer using the paddle attachment (or in a large bowl if using an electric hand mixer), beat butter on medium speed until it is light and creamy, about 3-5 minutes.
3. Set speed to low and slowly start adding powdered sugar, a cup at a time.
   - Add cocoa powder (and mix well) before the powdered sugar if making a chocolate frosting.
4. Mix until sugar is incorporated and then increase to medium speed for about 2-3 minutes.
5. While it's still mixing, add heavy cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Start with 2 tablespoons of heavy cream and add in a bit more if the mixture looks like it needs to be thicker.
6. Continue mixing on medium-high speed for 3-5 minutes or until buttercream is well combined and fluffy. Scrape the sides of the bowl as needed to be sure everything is mixed together.
7. Buttercream is ready to use as a crumb-coat or final frosting!

**Notes**

- Food coloring can be added if desired. Gel coloring is recommended and added to the buttercream one drop at a time. Be sure to fully incorporate the color into the buttercream.

- The thickness of the buttercream can be adjusted by either adding more powdered sugar (thicker) or more cream (thinner).

- For a white buttercream and better coloring results, be sure to use a _clear_ vanilla extract. Regular extract will tend to make the buttercream slightly yellow-ish.
