# Quinoa Au Gratin

Serves: 8

## Ingredients

* 1 cup uncooked quinoa
* 2 tbsp butter
* 2 tbsp flour
* 2 cups milk
* 1 1/2 cups sharp cheddar cheese
* Topping (mix together)
  * 1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs
  * 1 tbsp melted butter

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350&deg;.
2. Cook quinoa per package directions
    * I usually wash quinoa & boil in 2 cups of water for every 1 cup of quinoa for 15 minutes.
3. While quinoa cooks, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
4. Add flour and cook into a roux, until light brown with a nutty aroma.
5. Add milk to the roux, 1 cup at a time, whisking frequently to prevent clumping.
6. Bring milk mixture to a boil and then simmer for 2 minutes until thickened.
7. Add shredded cheese, whisking until the cheese has incorporated into the sauce.
8. Drain quinoa, if necessary, and place into a medium size (13"x13") casserole dish.
9. Add cheese sauce, stirring until combined. Sauce will appear runny but will thicken up during bake.
10. Sprinkle topping over quinoa mixture and bake for about 10 minutes.
11. Set oven to broil for about 1 1/2 minutes to give dish a browned crust.
