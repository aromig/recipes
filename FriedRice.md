Serves: About 4

## Ingredients

- 4 cups of cold cooked white rice&#x2726; (1-2 days old in fridge)
- neutral oil (vegetable or canola)
- 2 tbsp light soy sauce
- 3 large eggs
- meat of your choice (chicken, beef, pork, shrimp, etc), cut into small pieces ~1 inch
- 8 oz mixed vegetables (or the vegetables of your choice)
- 2 tsp minced garlic
- &frac12; tsp ginger

## Directions

1. Cook/steam vegetables accordingly while preparing the fried rice.
2. Heat non-stick pan or wok to medium-high heat and add 2 tbsp oil.
3. Beat eggs and add to pan/wok. Cook until lightly scrambled. Set aside.
4. Cook (or reheat if leftover) meat, seasoning as preferred. If more oil is needed for this, add as needed. When meat is done cooking, toss with dash of soy sauce and stir. Set aside.
5. Add ginger &amp; garlic. Stir together.
6. Add the rice and stir-fry for 3-4 minutes, breaking up the rice clumps with the back of your utensil (spoon, rice paddle). Sprinkle in pepper and MSG to taste.
7. Stir in soy sauce and add meat, eggs, &amp; vegetables. Add more soy sauce, if needed, to taste.
8. Heat for 2-3 minutes, stirring and/or [tossing](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/m74C3MK5tVc) to coat & cook everything evenly.
9. Serve up fried rice. Can top with more soy sauce if wanted, or try something else... like sweet chili!

_**Masarap!**_

&#x2726; Store cooked rice after it cools to room temperature (within 2 hours of cooking). Refridgerating warm rice can cause bacteria to grow.
